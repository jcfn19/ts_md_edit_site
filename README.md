# Ts md user manual
 A typescript app that lets users with permission edit a websites contents/user manual in markdown. Uses [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) to enable editing in markdown. Backend made with ts, express & better-sqlite3. Uses express-session for the login form. Uppercase for both usernames and passwords on login for the temp users. The data that is inserted into the db is compressed to make it easier to store large amounts of text.
